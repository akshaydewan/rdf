# Reality Distortion Field
This is a silly application that distorts a sentence by adding random adjectives and phrases. These adjectives are overused by a certain individual when making a sales pitch.

The program uses the [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/) module to analyze sentence and uses [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) for the web front-end.
